        Hello All,
  
        Thanks for the sharing the details of unused sites. We have removed more than 200 sites out of 366. This activity has free up few GBs Space on live1.
        
        I would need your support in database as well, So that we can optimize the huge amount of Space and Memory from the server.
        
        I have attached spreadsheet  file which contains names of all the database, would be good if you mark as red and revert me unused databases and green for keeping it active. Please complete this activity before 9th September 2019 EOD..
